# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

This project is a Python-based simulation of the Solar System using **Pygame** and mathematical concepts to visualize orbital mechanics, asteroid belts, and planetary rotations. It's a fun way to learn about programming, math, and space!

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Planets orbiting the Sun**: Each planet moves in a circular trajectory around the Sun.
- **Planetary self-rotation**: Simulates the rotation of planets on their axes.
- **Asteroid belt**: A ring of randomly placed asteroids between Mars and Jupiter.
- **Saturn's rings**: Realistic elliptical rings around Saturn.
- **Customizable parameters**: Easily adjust distances, sizes, and speeds.
